    <h3 class="widgettitle">JavaScript Lovers</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/pie.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> We at AppsAttic not only know JavaScript but we like
      it too! <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is our library of choice which we know inside
      out. <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> is also a favourite of ours on the server.

    <h3 class="widgettitle">Perl Experts</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/mouse.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> With over 10 years experience with Perl, we think
      we know how to handle it. Many of our <a href="http://www.appsdns.net/">webapps</a> are written in Perl as are
      many of our Open Source projects. Old crusty code or modern shiny stuff - it's our bread and butter!

    <h3 class="widgettitle">Cloud Masters</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/newspaper.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> Having
      used <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> since it's birth
      and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a> we're well versed in architectures which
      harness the power the cloud brings. Scalability and Reliability are our middle names!

    <h3 class="widgettitle">Open Source People</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/clock.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> Open source is a part of our pysche. We've used it
      for years, we've contributed code for years and we've enjoyed it all the way. Giving back to the community just
      makes us feel better ... there, we've said it now.

    <h3 class="widgettitle">NodeJS Winners</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/newspaper.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> When we see a disruptive technology
      like <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> we pounce. Having written <a href="/open-source/sensi/">Sensi</a>
      (an IaaS set of programs) in NodeJS we feel that the sheer power contained in just a few hundred lines of code is
      pure awesome. Really, you should check it out!

       <h3 class="widgettitle">GoLang Adopters</h3>
       <p>
         <img src="/s/icons/pie.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> <a href="http://golang.org/">GoLang</a> is our
         current favourite among our programming languages. The new way of thinking says we want power, speed and
         agility ... Go gives us all of that. Have you thought about using Go for your new product, if not, why not?

    <h3 class="widgettitle">StartUp Developers</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/pie.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> StartUps are a different way of thinking and we're
      not afraid to say we enjoy it - it suits us. If you need an MVP in 6 weeks or are looking to expand or scale your
      current system, talk to us about what we can do for you.

    <h3 class="widgettitle">PostgreSQL Fans</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/clock.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> We
      choose <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> as our preferred relational database over others. It
      fits with our mindset and it comes with some great features (transactional DDL anyone?). Let's just say we like
      it - we like it a lot!

  <div class="gs_3 omega">
    <h3 class="widgettitle">NoSQL Pioneers</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/mouse.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> We've been using NoSQL for years. Redis, MongoDB,
      CouchDB and Amazon SimpleDB (some would say Memcache too) are a part of our history which we know and love. Let's
      talk about focussing on getting the job done!
