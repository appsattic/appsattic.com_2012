    <h3 class="widgettitle">JavaScript Lovers</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/pie.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> We at AppsAttic not only know JavaScript but we like
      it too! Client side JS such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> (our library of choice) we know inside out
      and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQueryUI</a> is a great complement. Newer tools such
      as <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> and
      <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">backbone.js</a> are also firm favourites here.

    <h3 class="widgettitle">NodeJS Winners</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/newspaper.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> When we see a disruptive technology
      like <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> we pounce. Having written <a href="/open-source/sensi/">Sensi</a>
      (an IaaS set of programs) in NodeJS we feel that the sheer power contained in just a few hundred lines of code is
      pure awesome. Really, you should check it out!

    <p>
      <img src="/s/icons/mouse.png" alt="" class="alignleft icon" /> Having written API Libraries to lots (and lots,
      and lots, and lots) of Web APIs, we know a thing or two about talking to your service, or the services you depend
      on. With almost 100 GitHub watchers, <a href="https://github.com/appsattic/node-awssum/">node-awssum</a> is a
      great library to make your app talk to other sites. Talk to us to find out more!

      <a href="node-awssum/">[3]</a>). We've used it for years, we've contributed code for years and we've enjoyed it
      all the way. Giving back to the community just makes us feel better ... there, we've said it now.
